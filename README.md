# Breast-cancer-prediction-using-Machine Learning-model
Breast cancer data is taken from Kaggle (its an open source data repository), Breast cancer Wisconsin (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data). Here we are building and training the model to predict whether cancer is malignant (M) or benign (B).
First we upload the data set from Kaggle in csv format followed by training the model on those data sets (67% data are training data and 33% data are test data) by KNneighbors Classifiers (Supervised learning).
Once the model is trained we can use this model to predict the brest cancer outcome of an individual and to know the type of cancer in an individual (malignant or benign).
The more we train our model the better and accurate it will perform.
